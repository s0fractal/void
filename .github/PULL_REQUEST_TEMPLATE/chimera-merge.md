# ðŸ§¬ Chimera WASM Integration

## Overview
This PR introduces the complete Chimera WASM code-as-signal stack with full security controls and progressive rollout capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] **PR-A**: Environment flags & safety infrastructure (all disabled by default)
- [x] **PR-B**: WASM builder CLI with deterministic compilation
- [x] **PR-C**: FNPM CID resolver with IPFS/HTTP fallback
- [x] **PR-D**: Protein Hash for semantic code signatures
- [x] **PR-E**: WASM Executor with Wasmtime & policy engine
- [x] **PR-F**: Relay HTTP endpoint with idempotency & SSE
- [x] **PR-G**: Grafana dashboards for monitoring
- [x] **PR-H**: First Node collaborative coding app

### Security Features
- [ ] All features disabled by default
- [ ] Emergency freeze switch (CHIMERA_FREEZE)
- [ ] Cosign signatures for WASM modules
- [ ] OPA policy enforcement
- [ ] Rate limiting & idempotency
- [ ] Resource limits (memory, gas, time)
- [ ] Syscall auditing

## Pre-merge Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing (JS + Rust)
- [ ] Deterministic WASM builds verified
- [ ] Security scans clean (trivy, gitleaks)
- [ ] OPA policies tested
- [ ] k6 load test < 5% error rate
- [ ] Metrics exported correctly
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Rollout Plan
1. **Stage 1**: 1% canary (15 min)
2. **Stage 2**: 5% canary (15 min)
3. **Stage 3**: 10% canary (15 min)
4. **Stage 4**: 25% canary (15 min)
5. **Stage 5**: 50% canary (15 min)
6. **Stage 6**: 100% (with monitoring)

## Monitoring
- Error rate threshold: < 5%
- P95 latency threshold: < 300ms
- Policy violations: 0 expected
- Dashboards: `/grafana/d/chimera-overview`

## Rollback Plan
```bash
export WASM_EXEC_ENABLED=0 INTENT_WASM_ENABLED=0
# or
export CHIMERA_FREEZE=1
```

## Testing
```bash
# Pre-merge validation
./scripts/chimera-pre-merge-checklist.sh

# Post-merge canary
./scripts/chimera-rollout.sh start
```
