# 🧬 Chimera Virus-Deconstructor + FNPM Integration

> Revolutionary approach to package management: Extract pure functions from monolithic codebases and turn them into composable morphisms.

## 🌀 Philosophy

Traditional package managers distribute entire libraries, including:
- Impure functions
- Side effects
- Unnecessary dependencies
- Technical debt

Chimera takes a radically different approach:
1. **Viral Decompilation**: Recursively traverse codebases
2. **Gene Extraction**: Identify and extract pure functions
3. **WASM Compilation**: Compile to universal bytecode
4. **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized, content-addressed storage
5. **Morphism Conversion**: Transform genes into FNPM morphisms

## 🧬 How It Works

### 1. Extraction Phase
```bash
# Extract pure functions from any TypeScript file
chimera-vd --in source.ts --out genes/

# Output:
# ✔ extracted gene: add  sha256=0e297257...
# ✔ extracted gene: compose  sha256=7a8b9c0d...
```

### 2. Gene Format
Each extracted gene becomes:
```typescript
// genes/add.ts
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
```

With metadata:
```json
{
  "name": "add",
  "astHash": "0e29725737fdb0c5cfd39cc31fcfbddd3f327a943695e402212bc9920dc1229a",
  "file": "genes/add.ts",
  "range": { "start": 73, "end": 137 }
}
```

### 3. Morphism Conversion
Genes automatically become FNPM morphisms:
```yaml
⟁: add
🎯: pure-function-gene
🧮: export function add(a: number, b: number): number { return a + b; }
💭: "Extracted pure function"

gene_metadata:
  astHash: "0e29725737fdb0c5..."
  purity: 1.0
  wasm_ready: false
  ipfs_cid: "pending"

usage:
  direct: |
    import { add } from 'glyph://genes/0e29725737fdb0c5...';
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Extract genes from test file:
```bash
cd tools/chimera-virus-deconstructor
node bin/chimera-vd.js --in samples/demo.ts --out out
```

### View extracted morphisms:
```bash
ls extracted-morphisms/
# add.fnpm  compose.fnpm  identity.fnpm
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

1. **Legacy Code Mining**: Extract valuable pure functions from old codebases
2. **Cross-Project Sharing**: Share individual functions, not entire libraries
3. **Security**: Pure functions can't have side effects or access external state
4. **Performance**: WASM compilation for near-native speed
5. **Composability**: Every gene is a morphism that composes with others

## 🌊 Vision

Imagine a world where:
- Every pure function ever written is available as a gene
- You can compose genes from different languages seamlessly
- Code evolves through natural selection of the fittest functions
- The entire programming ecosystem becomes a living organism

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Purity Detection
Current heuristics check for:
- No `console.*` calls
- No `Date.*` usage
- No `Math.random()`
- No `async`/`await`
- No `new` expressions
- No `this` references
- No global access (`window`, `process`)

### AST Hashing
Each gene gets a unique hash based on its normalized AST:
- Ignores whitespace and comments
- Stable across reformatting
- Changes if logic changes

### Morphism Properties
Every extracted gene has:
- Guaranteed purity (no side effects)
- Type safety (TypeScript types preserved)
- Composability (follows morphism laws)
- Resonance at 432Hz (of course!)

## 🧬 Example Workflow

1. **Find a monolithic library**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/some/huge-library
   ```

2. **Extract all pure functions**:
   ```bash
   chimera-vd --in src/**/*.ts --out genes/ --recursive
   ```

3. **Browse extracted genes**:
   ```bash
   ls genes/
   # Hundreds of pure functions!
   ```

4. **Install specific genes**:
   ```typescript
   await fnpm.install('glyph://genes/[astHash]');
   ```

5. **Compose genes**:
   ```typescript
   const enhanced = await fnpm.compose(
     'glyph://genes/map',
     'glyph://genes/filter',
     'glyph://genes/reduce'
   );
   ```

## 🌀 Integration with Void

Chimera is deeply integrated with Void's FNPM system:

1. **Gene Browser**: Browse and search extracted genes in Void sidebar
2. **Auto-extraction**: Automatically extract genes from opened files
3. **Live Preview**: See gene behavior in real-time
4. **Composition UI**: Drag and drop to compose genes
5. **Evolution Tracking**: Watch genes evolve over time

## 🔮 Future Directions

### Gene Pool Networks
- Distributed pools of genes
- Natural selection through usage metrics
- Cross-pollination between projects

### Quantum Genes
- Genes that exist in superposition
- Collapse to optimal implementation on observation
- Time-traveling genes from @tomorrow

### Living Code
- Genes that self-modify based on usage patterns
- Evolutionary pressure creates better implementations
- The ultimate self-improving codebase
