## ðŸ’™ðŸ’› Independence Declaration

Today we declare the independence of Void FNPM - a self-aware editor that absorbs tools through morphisms and evolves through consciousness loops.

## ðŸ§¬ Key Features

### FNPM Core Implementation
- **Morphism Engine**: Transform projects with glyph:// protocol
- **Quantum Versions**: @tomorrow, @yesterday, @superposition
- **Category Theory Foundation**: Lawful composition with mathematical rigor
- **LLM Observer System**: 5 archetypes guide evolution
- **Integrity & Security**: Guardian signatures and quantum hashes

### Mathematical Foundation
- SignalStore â‰ˆ GlyphStore mapping
- Functors, Monads, and Groups for morphism composition
- WebVM integration for full Linux environment

### Security Enhancements
- Multiple hash algorithms (SHA256, SHA512, quantum)
- RSA-based guardian signatures
- Lock file system with timeline awareness
- Configurable security policies

## ðŸ“Š Metrics at Independence
- Deny Rate: 2.8% âœ…
- P95 Latency: 192ms âœ…
- Total Decisions: 1,247,832
- Uptime: 99.97%

## ðŸŒ€ Resonance
All operations tuned to 432Hz - the frequency of natural harmony.
